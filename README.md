# Console-based Personal Finance Tracker
- A command-line application for managing personal finances. Users can add income and expense transactions, categorise them, view a summary of their financial status, and save/load their data from a file. 
- A simple, single-file C++ console application to track **income** and **expenses**, summarise totals, search transactions, and generate **monthly reports**. Data is persisted in a plain-text file so your records survive between runs.

> ‚úÖ No external libraries.  
> ‚úÖ Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS (C++17).  
> ‚úÖ Human‚Äëreadable save file (`finance_data.txt`).

## ‚ú® Features

- Add **Income** or **Expense** with category, amount, description, and date (defaults to today).
- View all transactions in a neat table.
- Summaries:
  - **Totals** for income, expenses, balance
  - **Category-wise breakdown**
- **Monthly report** (choose month & year).
- **Search** by category, description keyword, or amount range.
- **Delete** by transaction ID.
- Auto-save after every change (to `finance_data.txt`).

## üß± How it Works (Design Overview)

- `Transaction` class: stores `id`, `type` (INCOME/EXPENSE), `category`, `amount`, `description`, `date` (YYYY-MM-DD).
- `FinanceManager` class: holds the list, next ID, and the data file. Implements:
  - `addTransaction`, `viewTransactions`, `viewSummary`, `monthlyReport`,
    `searchTransactions`, `deleteTransaction`
  - `saveData()` and `loadData()` to persist/restore from `finance_data.txt`
- **Categories** (editable in code):
  - Income: Salary, Freelance, Investment, Gift, Other Income
  - Expense: Food, Transport, Housing, Entertainment, Healthcare, Education, Shopping, Utilities, Other Expense

## üñ•Ô∏è Build Instructions

> Requires a C++17 compiler.

### Windows (MSVC)
```bat
cl /EHsc /std:c++17 main.cpp /Fe:FinanceTracker.exe
FinanceTracker.exe
```

### Windows (MinGW) / Linux / macOS (Clang or GCC)
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -o finance_tracker main.cpp
./finance_tracker
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

On launch you‚Äôll see a menu:

```
1. Add Transaction
2. View All Transactions
3. View Financial Summary
4. Generate Monthly Report
5. Search Transactions
6. Delete Transaction
7. Exit
```

### Add Transaction
- Choose **Income** or **Expense**
- Pick a **category**
- Enter **amount** (positive)
- Add a **description**
- Confirm **date** (defaults to today; or enter `YYYY-MM-DD`)

### Search Options
- By **category** (partial matches OK)
- By **description** keyword
- By **amount range** (min‚Äìmax)

### Delete
- First list all to see IDs, then enter the ID to delete. Auto-saves afterward.

## üíæ Data & File Format

- Save file: `finance_data.txt` (created in the current working directory).
- First line stores `nextId`. Each transaction uses a `|`-delimited line:

```
<id>|<type>|<category>|<amount>|<description>|<date>
```

Where:
- `<type>` is `0` for INCOME and `1` for EXPENSE
- `<date>` is `YYYY-MM-DD`

**Example:**
```
12|1|Food|380.50|Groceries for the week|2025-09-09
13|0|Salary|75000|Monthly salary|2025-09-01
```

> Tip: You can back up or version-control `finance_data.txt` to keep history.

## üõ†Ô∏è Notes & Extensibility

- **Change categories** inside `FinanceManager` (the `incomeCategories` and `expenseCategories` vectors).
- **Date parsing** for monthly reports expects `YYYY-MM-DD` (year‚Äëmonth used for filtering).
- **Input validation** is basic‚Äîconsider expanding it (e.g., forbid very long descriptions).
- Possible future additions:
  - Export reports to CSV/JSON
  - Budgets & alerts
  - Recurring transactions
  - Better CLI navigation / colors
  - Unit tests

---

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

- **I don‚Äôt see my old data.** Ensure you are running the program from the same working directory that contains `finance_data.txt`.
- **Build errors about C++ standard.** Make sure your compiler flag includes `-std=c++17` (or `/std:c++17` with MSVC).
- **Unicode/locale issues.** Stick to ASCII in descriptions if your terminal doesn‚Äôt support your locale.
